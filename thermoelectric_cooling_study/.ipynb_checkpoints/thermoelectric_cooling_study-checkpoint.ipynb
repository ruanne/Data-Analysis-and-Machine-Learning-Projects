    "The data is accessible on the [Open Energy Initiative platform](https://data.openei.org/submissions/4038). The data is organised in 6 spreadsheets, one for each year from 2014 to 2019. The thermoelectric cooling information per power plant is given in each file.  Each spreadsheet details the generator type, fuel consumption, water consumption, cooling type, and equipment status, location, and water source of each plant. "
